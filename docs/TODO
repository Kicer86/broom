Sets of tasks: finished, to be done, dropped

TODO:
- Model: filter out top level groups without any children
- Staging Model: automatically move added photos to right posistions
- use faster thumbnailer (https://code.google.com/p/ffmpegthumbnailer/)
- core: make photos tagger a new task
- core: PhotoInfo should store information about which data have been loaded and which not. Even empty photo should be storen in database and updated on every change

- rethink configuration concepts
- when updating photo, do not update all, update only required data
