Required tools and libraries:
 - cmake - version 3.0 or later
 - Qt5 - version 5.5 or higher
 - hash-library*
 - easyexif*
 - GMock and GTest
 - jsoncpp*
 - OpenLibrary
 - Boost

 Optional libraries (for crash catching):
 - KCrash (Linux/Windows)
 - libbacktrace (Linux)*
 - dbghelp (Windows)
 - StackWalker (Windows)*

* PhotoBroom at configuration phase will additionaly search for marked libraries in (TOP_SOURCE_DIR)/3rd_party/.
  So if it is not installed in your system you may:
  - cd photo_broom_sources
  - mkdir 3rd_party
  - cd 3rd_party
  - git clone https://github.com/mayanklahiri/easyexif.git
  - git clone http://create.stephan-brumme.com/hash-library/.git
  - git clone https://github.com/open-source-parsers/jsoncpp.git
  - git clone https://github.com/ErwanLegrand/libbacktrace.git
  - download StackWalker from https://stackwalker.codeplex.com/ and unzip it, so the StackWalker directory
    will be the top one (skip 'Main' directory)

Tested compilers:
1. gcc  (Linux and Windows)
        At least 4.8.0 version is required (due to c++14).

2. clang (Linux)

VisualStudio is not supported due to missing support for c++11/14.

PhotoBroom cannot be run from compilation dir without installing.
On Linux it will search for plugins in destination (installation) dir.
Build 'install' target to install PhotoBroom. Then you can launch it.
On Windows operating system, PhotoBroom searches for plugins and translations,
in location relative to exe file.
To make debuging possible on Windows, set DEVELOPER_BUILD option to ON.
This will force PhotoBroom to look for plugins and translations in location
defined by CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX (so as it does on Linux).

Extra targets available for Windows:
'deploy' - prepares extra dir with Qt's libraries and plugins required by PhotoBroom.
'install' target will install not only PhotoBroom's files but also Qt's libraries and translations. Other libraries will be also included.
'package' target will create a package (Intallator) with all files required for runing PhotoBroom on other Windows machines
