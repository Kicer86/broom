Required tools and libraries:
 - cmake - version 3.0 or later
 - Qt5 - version 5.5 or higher
 - easyexif*
 - GMock and GTest
 - jsoncpp*
 - OpenLibrary*
 - Boost

 Optional libraries (for crash catching):
 - KCrash + drkonqi (Linux/Windows)

* For convenience it is possible to use prepared CMake script
  for download, build and install of marked libraris.
  If you want to use this feature take cmake/third_party directory
  as CMake source dir. Place output dir somewhere outise photo broom sources.
  
  By default none of the marked libraries will be build.
  It is necessary to enable each library manually with particular CMake variable.

  set BUILD_* variable to ON for library you want to be downloaded.

Tested compilers:
1. gcc  (Linux and Windows)
        At least 4.8.0 version is required (due to c++14).

2. clang (Linux)

VisualStudio is not supported due to missing support for c++11/14.

PhotoBroom cannot be run from compilation directory without installing.
On Linux it will search for plugins in destination (installation) directory.
Build 'install' target to install PhotoBroom. Then you can launch it.
On Windows operating system, PhotoBroom searches for plugins and translations,
in location relative to exe file.

There is CMake DEVELOPER_BUILD variable available to ease debugging of some features.
Then set to ON gui internal crash catcher will run and attach to dummy application.
On Windows, DEVELOPER_BUILD option will force PhotoBroom to look for plugins and translations in location
defined by CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX (so as it does on Linux) not in build directory.

Extra targets available for Windows:
'deploy' - prepares extra dir with Qt's libraries and plugins required by PhotoBroom.
'install' target will install not only PhotoBroom's files but also Qt's libraries and translations.
          Other libraries will be also included.
'package' target will create a package (Installator) with all files required for running
          PhotoBroom on other Windows machines.
