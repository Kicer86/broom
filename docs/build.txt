PhotoBroom cannot be run from build directory without installation step.
On Linux it will search for plugins in destination (installation) directory.
Build 'install' target to install PhotoBroom. Then you can launch it.
On Windows operating system, PhotoBroom searches for plugins and translations,
in location relative to exe file.

There is CMake DEVELOPER_BUILD variable available to ease debugging.
On Windows, DEVELOPER_BUILD option will force PhotoBroom to look for plugins and translations in location
defined by CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX (so as it does on Linux) not in build directory.
Has no effect on Linux.


Extra targets available for Windows:
'deploy'  prepares extra dir with all external dependencies required by PhotoBroom.
'install' install PhotoBroom with all external dependencies
'package' target will create a package (Installator) with all files required for running
          PhotoBroom on other Windows machines.
