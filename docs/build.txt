        Qt 5.0 is minimum.
        gcc has support for OpenMP which will be used for various tasks.

2. clang (Linux)

3. Visual studio (Windows)
    Visual Studio 2013 at least is required with Visual C++ Compiler Nov 2013 CTP (CTP_Nov2013) (due to c++11). Service Pack 2 is required (www.microsoft.com/pl-pl/download/details.aspx?id=42666)

Build steps:
1. Create dir for output files. It is usually 'build' directory in top of the sources.
2. Run 'cmake /path/to/sources'. If build directory was used as suggested, then this form can be used: 'cmake ..'
3. When it is ready Makefiles or sln files should be created and you can use make or Visual Studio to finish compilation.

PhotoBroom cannot be run from compilation dir without installing. It will search for plugins in destination (installation) dir.
Build 'install' target to install PhotoBroom. When you can launch it.
